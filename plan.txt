lets make this: 

a python program that listens to my sdr on a freq and listens for a transmission that says a callsign in the nato phonetic alphabet followed by "signal report"

it will need to use speech to text to do this. it will need to be offline. only use offline text to speech and speech to text packages. 

i.e. "kilo romeo 4 delta tango tango signal report"

it needs to do a simple validation that before the words "signal report" the callsign matches the callsign format

then it will use text to speech using pyttsx3 to read back the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Report from the sdr like this "Your signal is S9 with an SNR of 20 dB."

it will transmit this via this cable attached to a quansheng radio attached to my pc: https://baofengtech.com/product/aprs-k1-pro
This is a special cable that has Auto PTT and Real-Time Data Relaying: The APRS-K1 PRO Cable automatically triggers PTT upon detecting an input signal and relays audio packets directly to your connected device, making it perfect for APRS, data logging, and remote operations.
